## Styles

### Basic

The first style that was developed. A very simple, functional design that is easy to adapt.


## Locally building this repository's styles

1. Make sure you have the `sass`  binary installed. (Such as the ruby version; `gem install sass`)
2. Run `./build_styles.sh`, which will compile and copy all `*.scss` files in the `styles/` folder to the `dist/` folder.
